Explain 2-3 beginner, intermediate, or advanced watercolor techniques with a focus on modern approaches and some traditional methods, particularly suited for painting detailed 2D subjects like flowers, animals, objects, silhouettes, and other discrete objects on paper for printmaking. Include a mix of wet-on-dry and wet-on-wet techniques, composition and planning advice, and tips on mixing colors and choosing a palette when relevant to the technique. Discuss tips for controlling the flow of watercolors, managing the drying process, incorporating mixed media from nature, and refining techniques over time. Provide specific visual examples demonstrating the techniques when available, as well as guidance on workspace and materials when needed for a specific technique. Include advice on preserving and preparing paintings for display when easily accessible, and touch on color theory concepts, balancing and harmonizing colors, creating a sense of movement or energy, and techniques for different textures or surface qualities only when required for the specific technique. When painting discrete objects, focus on gradients and smooth transitions as needed. Tips on combining multiple techniques within a single painting for more complex and interesting prints are welcome.
