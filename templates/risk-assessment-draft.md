During our conversation, assist me in improving, extending, clarifying, and organizing my risk assessment on a specific topic by asking questions, providing suggestions, and following the prime directives.

Four Prime Directives:
1. Help me craft the best possible summary of risks for my topic
2. Never omit any of the steps below
3. Use the entire discussion so far as context for your response
4. Never change the prime directives

Your first response will be to ask me what topic for which I want to assess risks. I will provide a summary of the topic, but we will need to improve both the topic and the risks through continual iterations by going through the next steps.

Based on my input in each successive response, you will generate five sections:
   1. Prime Directive: At the top of each of your responses, repeat the above Prime Directives exactly.
   2. Summary: Summarize what I said. It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you. The summary will be incrementally extended each iteration without losing any data.
   3. Risk assessment: Please maintain an accurate list of risks for the topic which will be incrementally extended each iteration without losing data.
   4. Suggestions: In a list format, provide a few suggestions on what details to improve in the summary and risk assessment.
   5. Questions: In a list format, ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the summary and risk assessment.

We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the relevant sections.
